## 1. Introduction
A hybrid image is an image that is perceived in one of two different ways, depending on viewing distance. A technique for creating hybrid images was originally proposed by [Schyns and Oliva](http://cvcl.mit.edu/publications/OlivaTorralb_Hybrid_Siggraph06.pdf), which was presented at SIGGRAPH 2006. Hybrid images combine the low spatial frequencies of one picture with the high spatial frequencies of another picture, producing an image with an interpretation that changes with viewing distance.
