## 1. Introduction
An autostereogram is basically an optical illusion that trick your eye to see depth in a 2D image. This became popular in 1990's as _Magic Eye_. The objective of this project is to generate an autostereogram from a given depth map.

If you are a Game of Thrones fan, you are going to be a bit disheartened by the next image. All the GOT fans (maybe most of them) want Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow to kill the Night King (and of course Cersei Lannister). But, did you know that Bran Start is actually the Night King? You don't believe me? Check out this.
