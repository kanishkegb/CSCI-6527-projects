## 1. Introduction
A hybrid image is an image that is perceived in one of two different ways, depending on viewing distance. A technique for creating hybrid images was originally proposed by [Schyns and Oliva](http://cvcl.mit.edu/publications/OlivaTorralb_Hybrid_Siggraph06.pdf), which was presented at [SIGGRAPH](https://www.siggraph.org/) 2006. Hybrid images combine the low spatial frequencies of one picture with the high spatial frequencies of another picture, producing an image with an interpretation that changes with viewing distance.

Above is an example for a hybrid image. The top image is an hybrid image of two images at the bottom. If you are close enough to the top figure, you will see Albert Einstein, while if you move further from the image, or blur your eyes, you will see Marilyn Monroe.
